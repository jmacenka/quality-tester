# Quality Tester

Web-Tool for "End of Line - Qualty Station" Simulation from ROI EFESO.

Intended to be run on a Raspberry PI. There is a Ansible deployment-script that will configure any new Raspberry Pi that is loaded with the RaspianOS that also includes a desktop.

About 95% of this project was written by ChatGPT and it does not really follow SoftwareDevelopment pest practices (I know... but it had to be done quick and dirty).
